# Welcome Twitch Guides by JonForest

[Twitch Help Center](https://help.twitch.tv/) is good but not good enough. For example, it's still missing basic help articles for new Twitch Desktop users. The app has several useful features such as polls and giveaways. All users just can't bother to click or even hover all the buttons in client.

The goal of this page is to complete Help Center and guide Twitch users in topics that were not covered good enough on Twitch's official help articles.
