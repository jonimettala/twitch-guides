*A guide to Polls and Giveaways*

In Twitch Desktop there are two kind of events: polls and giveaways. Polls are used to ask questions and giveaways to organize giveaways for your community.

## Using Polls & Giveaways

Current polls and giveaways can be seen by clicking the Event icon in any server.

If a poll is running, you can vote by clicking first your option and then submitting it by clicking *Vote*. Voting may be also possible on web browser without a Twitch account if set so while creating the poll.

After submitted your vote, you can see the results of the poll.

# Setting up Polls & Giveaways as admin

Poll and giveaway settings can be found in admin panel behind Events tab.

## Polls

**Question**: Set your poll question and the answer options. There may be over two options, new fields will become visible when you enter more options.

**Type of graph**: Decide whether you want to show results as a bar or pie graph.

**Allow public votion**: Set this on if you want to allow people to vote outside of Twitch Desktop with their web broser. Useful for asking questions during a stream.

**Prevent duplicates**: Can be set to **Restrict by Cookie (Recommended)**, **Restrict by IP**, or **No restictions**. You can prevent a single user replying a same poll several times with this option. Setting this to *No restrictions* allows a single person to vote multiple times which may affect to your poll results negatively.

**Allow multiple choises**: Allows a user to choose multiple options.

**Allow revotes**: Allow a user to change their vote later.

**Restrict poll to certain roles**: If you want to exclude non-subscribers or some other server role from voting, it is possible with this option. The option will allow you to choose with checkboxes which server roles will be able to vote.

**Limited time poll**: You can set the poll automatically end in 1-60 minutes, 1-24 hours, or 1-30 days.

After creating a poll, you can see its results and copy its public address (if public voting allowed).

## Giveaways

**Title**: Set a title for your giveaway

**Require role to win**: You can manually select which server roles are able to win.

**Auto enter roles**: You can select which server roles will automatically be entered to giveaway. This may be a good subscriber perk.

**Include offline members**: You can choose whether offline members are entered or not.

**Auto claim roles**: Select which roles will automatically claim their win if they win.

**Prevent duplicate winners**: A single user can't win multiple time in the same giveaway if enabled.

**Claim time**: 30 seconds - 5 minutes. In which amount of time winner must claim their prize.

**Sharing bonus**: Likely to give higher chance of winning for people who share the poll. I may be wrong though.

**Ignore list**: Exclude users from the giveaway for a reason or another.

## Past events

In admin panel, you can see lists of your past polls and giveaways - if there are any.
